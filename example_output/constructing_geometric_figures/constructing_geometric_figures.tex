**Draw an isosceles trapezoid with two sets of angles $59^\circ$ and $121^\circ$ and a set of bases of length $a$ and $2.5a$ where $a$ is any positive number.** 

**With these conditions, is the trapezoid unique?**

\paragraph{Ans} 

Yes

\fbox{ No

\paragraph{Hint 1}An isosceles trapezoid has four sides with two parallel bases and two nonparallel sides equal in length.

Let's choose any positive value for $\blue{a}$ and draw a trapezoid given the conditions.

\paragraph{Hint 2}If $\blue{a}=\blue{4}$, then lets draw parallel bases of length $\blue4$ and length $\blue{10}$. Let's adjust the height of the trapezoid until we draw $\blue{59^\circ}$ and $\blue{121^\circ}$ angles and have nonparallel sides equal in length.


\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/3fc1a3de04ae5beee01136dbc98446947a8f58f8.png}

\paragraph{Hint 3}We know only the measures of the four angles, do not know the measures of the nonparallel sides, and can choose any positive value for $\blue{a}$. We can draw more than one isosceles trapezoid of the same shape but different size.

\paragraph{Hint 4}With the given conditions, the isosceles trapezoid is not unique.

**Draw a quadrilateral with a set of $104^\circ$ angles, a set of $76^\circ$ angles, a set of sides length $6$, and a set of sides length $5.2$.** 

**Is there a unique quadrilateral that satisfies the given conditions?**
[[? interactive-graph 1]]

\paragraph{Ans} 

\fbox{ Yes

}

 No



\paragraph{Hint 1}A quadrilateral has four straight sides and four angles. Since we have two sets of equal angles and two sets of equal sides sides, we have a parallelogram where opposite sides are parallel. 

Let’s start by drawing a parallelogram.

\paragraph{Hint 2}A parallelogram has two sets of equal angles opposite each other. There is a set of acute (less than $\purple{90^\circ}$) angles and a set of obtuse angles (greater than $\purple{90^\circ}$). In general, all four angles of a quadrilateral sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$.

We have a set of acute angles $\blue{76^\circ}$ and a set of obtuse angles  $\blue{104^\circ}$. Our angles sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$.

\paragraph{Hint 3}Since we are given the measures of the four angles and four sides,  we can draw parallelograms of one shape and one size. 

\paragraph{Hint 4}With the given conditions, the quadrilateral is unique.

\paragraph{Ans} 

\fbox{ Yes

}

 No



\paragraph{Hint 1}A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two sets of equal sides sides parallel each other. 

Let’s start by drawing a parallelogram with two bases of length $\blue7$ parallel to each other and a height of $\blue5$. The height is the vertical distance perpendicular to both bases.

\paragraph{Hint 2}A parallelogram has two sets of equal angles opposite each other. There is a set of acute (less than $\purple{90^\circ}$) angles and a set of obtuse angles (greater than $\purple{90^\circ}$). In general, all four angles of a quadrilateral sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$.

We have a set of acute angles $\blue{45^\circ}$. By drawing, we find a set of obtuse angles  $\blue{135^\circ}$. Our angles sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$.

\paragraph{Hint 3}Since we are given the shape is a parallelogram and know a set of angles, set of bases and height, we can draw a parallelogram of one shape and one size. 

\paragraph{Hint 4}With the given conditions, the parallelogram is unique.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles and two sets of equal sides sides parallel to each other. 

Let’s start by drawing a rectangle with both diagonals of length $\blue{13}$. The diagonals of a rectangle intersect at each other at their midpoints.


\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/ee8eceeffd155a94f3bf574f7d8664ee513f60ee.png}

\paragraph{Hint 2}Let's connect the endpoints of our diagonals to create a rectangle.

**Draw a trapezoid with $135^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ angles, two sets of perpendicular sides, and parallel bases of lengths $8$ and $14$?.**

**Is there a unique trapezoid that satisfies the given conditions?**
[[? interactive-graph 1]]

\paragraph{Ans} 

\fbox{ Yes

}

 No



\paragraph{Hint 1}Let’s start by drawing.  A trapezoid has four sides and at least one pair of parallel sides.  

Let's start by drawing a trapezoid with two sets of perpendicular sides. 

\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/75d41dbb8e47cf8e05fb47080572010c94d2ae60.png}

Next, we can adjust the length of the parallel bases to be of lengths $\blue8$ and $\blue{14}$.

\paragraph{Hint 2}Let's adjust the height of the trapezoid until we have $\blue{135^\circ}$ and $\blue{45^\circ}$ angles. The $\blue{45^\circ}$ angles must be next to the longest side length $\blue{14}$. We find the height is $\blue6$.

We can draw only one trapezoid of the given shape and size.

\paragraph{Hint 3}With the given conditions, the trapezoid is unique.

**Is there a unique quadrilateral that satisfies the given conditions?**
[[? interactive-graph 1]]

\paragraph{Ans} 

Yes

\fbox{ No

}

 

\paragraph{Hint 1}A quadrilateral has four straight sides and four angles. A quadrilateral with four right angles is either a square or rectangle. 

The height is drawn perpendicular to both bases. The set of bases $\blue{a}$ and a height $\blue{2a}$ are different lengths, so let's draw a rectangle. Let's choose any positive value for $\blue{a}$ and draw.

\paragraph{Hint 2}If $\blue{a}=\blue{1}$, then lets draw a rectangle with width $\blue1$ and length $\blue2$.


\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/08454fd7d8ef8a2085d44ab354b50ccd27560047.png}

\paragraph{Hint 3}Since $\blue{a}$ can be any positive number,  we can draw multiple rectangles given the conditions. The quadrilateral is not unique.

 More than one



\paragraph{Hint 1}Let’s start by drawing.  A trapezoid has four sides and at least one pair of parallel sides.  

The side of length $\blue{2.5}$ is perpendicular to both bases, so $\blue{2.5}$ is the height.

\paragraph{Hint 2}The bases of lengths $\blue{10}$ and of length $\blue{5}$ can be drawn at a perpendicular distance of $\blue{2.5}$ to each other.

\paragraph{Hint 3}With the given conditions, we can draw only one trapezoid.

[[? interactive-graph 1]]

\paragraph{Ans} 

Yes

\fbox{ No

}

 

\paragraph{Hint 1}A kite is a quadrilateral with four sides and four angles. A kite has two pairs of equal sides which are next to each other. 

Let's start by drawing a right $\blue{90}^\circ$ angle.

\paragraph{Hint 2}From the right angle, let's draw two sides equal in length. Then, let's form the two $\blue{93}^\circ$ angles by drawing an acute angle opposite the $\blue{90}^\circ$ angle. 

An acute angle is less than $\blue{90}^\circ$.

\paragraph{Hint 3}We know the shape of the kite, but we do not know its size. We do not know the lengths of its sides or diagonals.

\paragraph{Hint 4}With the given conditions, the kite is not unique.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A quadrilateral is a plane figure with four straight sides and four angles. 

We know all four sides are equal and of length $\blue5$. Since all sides are perpendicular, we know the measures of each of the four angles to be $\blue{90^\circ}$.

Let's start by drawing.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal. A parallelogram has four straight sides where opposite sides are parallel. 

Let’s start by drawing a rhombus with a set of $\blue{45^\circ}$ angles.

\paragraph{Hint 2}A parallelogram has a set of acute angles (less than $\purple{90^\circ}$) and a set of obtuse angles (greater than $\purple{90^\circ}$). In general, all four angles of a parallelogram sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$. 

We are given a set of acute angles $\blue{45^\circ}$. By drawing we can find the measure of the set of obtuse angles $\blue{135^\circ}$. All four angles sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$.

\paragraph{Hint 3}Since we know only the measures of the four angles and do not know the measures of the four sides, we can draw more than one rhombus of the same shape but different size.

\paragraph{Hint 4}With the given conditions, the rhombus is not unique.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A quadrilateral is a plane figure with four straight sides and four angles. Right angles are $\blue{{90}^\circ}$ angles. Parallel sides are an equal distant apart at every point.

Let's start by drawing two right angles:

We now have two sets of perpendicular sides and one set of parallel lines.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A parallelogram is quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel and equal sides. 

A parallelogram has two sets of equal angles opposite each other. There is a set of acute (less than $\purple{90^\circ}$) angles and a set of obtuse angles (greater than $\purple{90^\circ}$). In general, all four angles of a quadrilateral sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$.

Let's start by drawing.

\paragraph{Hint 2}If a parallelogram has only a set of $\blue{90^\circ}$ angles, then the remaining set of angles must be $\blue{90^\circ}$ as well to sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$. In this case, our parallelogram would be a rectangle or square and could not have a set of obtuse angles.

**Draw a trapezoid with parallel bases of lengths $15$ and $6$ and a side of length $13$ which is perpendicular to both bases.** 

**Is there a unique trapezoid that satisfies the given conditions?**
[[? interactive-graph 1]]

\paragraph{Ans} 

\fbox{ Yes

}

 No



\paragraph{Hint 1}Let’s start by drawing.  A trapezoid has four sides and at least one pair of parallel sides.  

The side of length $\blue{13}$ is perpendicular to both bases, so $\blue{13}$ is the height.

\paragraph{Hint 2}The bases of lengths $\blue{6}$ and of length $\blue{15}$ can be drawn at a perpendicular distance of $\blue{13}$.

We can draw only one trapezoid.

\paragraph{Hint 3}With the given conditions, the trapezoid is unique.

**How many parallelograms can be drawn with a set of $45^\circ$ angles, bases of length $3$ and a height of length $1$?**

\paragraph{Ans} 

None

\fbox{ Only one

 More than one



\paragraph{Hint 1}A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two sets of equal sides sides parallel each other. 

Let’s start by drawing a parallelogram with two bases of length $\blue3$ parallel to each other and a height of $\blue1$. The height is the vertical distance perpendicular to both bases.

\paragraph{Hint 2}A parallelogram has two sets of equal angles opposite each other. There is a set of acute (less than $\purple{90^\circ}$) angles and a set of obtuse angles (greater than $\purple{90^\circ}$). In general, all four angles of a quadrilateral sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$.

We have a set of acute angles $\blue{45^\circ}$. By drawing, we find a set of obtuse angles  $\blue{135^\circ}$. Our angles sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$.

\paragraph{Hint 3}Since we are given the shape is a parallelogram and know a set of angles, set of bases and height, we can draw a parallelogram of one shape and one size.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A quadrilateral is a plane figure with four straight sides and four angles. 

We are given four right angles, so we can draw either a rectangle or a square.

\paragraph{Hint 2}A set of sides is length $\blue5$. The length of the other two sides is unknown. We can draw a square with all sides length $\blue5$. 

\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/f01a7ac0b5a47c41c03d6609f8ba8c6e24144389.png} 

We cannot draw any other size square. Can we draw any other shape?

\paragraph{Hint 3}We can draw many rectangles.


\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/7927be933ad149d8dd41e876ffe45fbdb4998383.png}

Since we are not given the measure of the other two sides, we can draw many quadrilaterals of different shapes and sizes.

\paragraph{Hint 4}Given the conditions, more than one quadrilateral can be drawn.

 Only one

\paragraph{Hint 1}A parallelogram is quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel and equal sides. We know the two pairs of parallel sides are of lengths $\blue3$ and $\blue6$. 

Let's try to draw a parallelogram with only one set of perpendicular sides.

\paragraph{Hint 2}A parallelogram has two sets of equal angles. There is a set of acute (less than $\purple{90^\circ}$) angles and a set of obtuse angles (greater than $\purple{90^\circ}$). In general, any quadrilateral has $\pink{360^\circ}$ total.

If a parallelogram has only one set of perpendicular (or $\purple{90^\circ}$) sides, then the remaining sides must be $\purple{90^\circ}$ as well.

\paragraph{Hint 3}If our parallelogram were a rectangle, then it cannot have only one set of perpendicular sides. A rectangle has two sets of perpendicular sides.

\paragraph{Hint 4}Given the conditions, no quadrilaterals can be drawn.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal. A parallelogram has four straight sides where opposite sides are parallel. 

Let’s start by drawing a rhombus with all four sides equal to $\blue{8.5}$.

\paragraph{Hint 2}A parallelogram has a set of acute angles (less than $\purple{90^\circ}$) and a set of obtuse angles (greater than $\purple{90^\circ}$). In general, all four angles of a parallelogram sum to $\pink{360^\circ}$.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A quadrilateral is a plane figure with four straight sides and four angles. Right angles are $\blue{{90}^\circ}$ angles. Parallel sides are an equal distant apart at every point.

The height  $\blue{a}$ is drawn perpendicular to both bases of length  $\blue{a}$ and  $\blue{2a}$. Let's choose any positive value for $\blue{a}$ and draw.
