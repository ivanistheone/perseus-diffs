**How many triangles can be drawn where the side length is known between two known angles?**

\paragraph{Ans} 

None

\fbox{ Only one

}

 More than one



\paragraph{Hint 1}Let's draw an example of a triangle where the side length is known between $2$ angles. Let's look at when a side of length $5$ is between a pair of $75^\circ$ angles.

\paragraph{Hint 2}The other two sides can be drawn at $75^\circ$ angles  and are equal in length. The sides meet at a $30^\circ$ angle to complete the triangle. 


\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/8664b06c420b8bf33711310103a6963e0f2cc7f1.png}

This triangle is unique, meaning no other triangle exists with exact same shape or size.

\paragraph{Hint 3}If  the side length is known between two known angles, only one triangle can be drawn.

**How many triangles can be drawn with side lengths $9$, $12$ and $15$?**

\paragraph{Ans} 

None

\paragraph{Hint 1}A triangle is a plane figure with $3$ straight sides and $3$ angles. Can we satisfy the definition given the conditions? Let's try to draw a triangle given the conditions.

\paragraph{Hint 2}In general, the longest side of a triangle must be shorter than the sum of the two other sides. Because $\blue{9}+\blue{12} =\blue{21}$, the two sides $\blue{9}$ and $\blue{12}$ meet to form $2$ angles with the side of length $\blue{15}$. We can create $3$ angles with the $3$ sides to satisfy the definition of a triangle.

\paragraph{Ans} 

Yes

\fbox{ No

\paragraph{Hint 1}Let’s start by choosing a value for $\pink{a}$ where $\pink{a}>0$, then we can draw a triangle with side lengths $\purple5\pink{a}$, $\purple{12}\pink{a}$ and $\purple{13}\pink{a}$.

\paragraph{Hint 2}If $\pink{a}=1$, then we can draw a triangle with side lengths  $\blue{5}$, $\blue{12}$ and $\blue{13}$. This is a right triangle. 


\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/6d298ed14c507f692b6d88792d963d7008b9847a.png}

\paragraph{Hint 3}If $\pink{a}=0.5$, then we can draw a right triangle with side lengths $\blue{2.5}$, $\blue{6}$ and $\blue{6.5}$.

\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/463955e595c31361c49d853aea12289b0f5f7779.png}

We can let $\pink{a}$ be any nonzero positive number and draw many triangles of same shape but different sizes.

\paragraph{Hint 4}The triangle is not unique.

**Draw a triangle with side length $4$ between two $70^\circ$ angles.** 

**Given these criteria is the triangle unique?**
[[? interactive-graph 1]]

\paragraph{Ans} 

\fbox{ Yes

}

 No



\paragraph{Hint 1}Let’s start by drawing the length of $1$ side, which we know is $\blue4$.  

\paragraph{Hint 2}From the side $\blue4$, let’s draw $2$ $\blue{70^\circ}$ angles. Since we have $2$ equal angles, we have an isosceles triangle. An isosceles triangle has at least $2$ sides equal in length. 

Since we have $2$ $\blue{70^\circ}$ angles, the third angle must be $\green{40^\circ}$. The sum of $3$ angles in a triangle will always be $\pink{180^\circ}$.

\paragraph{Hint 3}We know the measure of $2$ angles and the length of the side between the angles, so we can draw only $1$ triangle.

\paragraph{Hint 4}The triangle is unique.

None

\paragraph{Hint 1}We do not know the measure of at least $1$ angle or length of the third side. We cannot create a unique triangle with only one shape and size.

\paragraph{Hint 2}We can  draw many triangles with side lengths $\blue5$ and $\blue{10}$.

\paragraph{Ans} 

None

\fbox{ Only one

 More than one



\paragraph{Hint 1}A triangle is a plane figure with $3$ straight sides and $3$ angles. The $3$ angles always add up to $\pink{180^\circ}$. 

We have $2$ $\blue{45^\circ}$ angles. The third angle $x$ is $\blue{90^\circ}$: 

\begin{align*} \pink{180^\circ}&= 2\cdot\blue{45^\circ} + x \\ \pink{180^\circ}&= \blue{90^\circ} + x \\
x &= \pink{180^\circ}-\blue{90^\circ} \\
x &= \blue{90^\circ} \end{align*}

Let's draw a right triangle. 

\paragraph{Hint 2}We can draw a triangle given the side length $\blue2$ is not between the $2$ $\blue{45^\circ}$ angles. The side length $\blue2$ is between the $\blue{45^\circ}$ and $\blue{90^\circ}$ angles.


\includegraphics[scale=\shrinkfactor]{figures/50ab52075216ec1ebe030aa80de8615558c71846.png}

This triangle is unique, meaning no other triangle exists with exact same shape or size.

\paragraph{Hint 3}Given the conditions, only one triangle can be drawn.

[[? interactive-graph 1]]

\paragraph{Ans} 

\fbox{ Yes

}

 No



\paragraph{Hint 1}Let’s start by drawing a right angle which is $\blue{90^\circ}$. 

Then, let's draw the side of length $\blue3$ next to the right angle, so our base is length $\blue3$.

\paragraph{Hint 2}The length of $\blue3$ is $\red{\text{not}}$ between $2$ angles $\blue{31^\circ}$ and $\blue{90^\circ}$. 

Since we drew the side of length $\blue3$ next to the right angle, the $\blue{31^\circ}$ angle must be *opposite* the side of length $\blue3$ .

\paragraph{Hint 3}We know the measure of $2$ angles and the length of $1$ side not between the angles, so we can draw only $1$ triangle.

\paragraph{Hint 4}The triangle is unique.

**How many right triangles can be drawn with angles $40^\circ$ and  $60^\circ$?**

\paragraph{Ans} 

\fbox{ None

}

 Only one

More than one



\paragraph{Hint 1}A triangle is a plane figure with $3$ straight sides and $3$ angles. The $3$ angles always add up to $\pink{180^\circ}$.

A right triangle has a $\blue{90}^\circ$  angle.

\paragraph{Hint 2}Let's add together the angles angles $\blue{40}^\circ$,  $\blue{60}^\circ$ and $\blue{90}^\circ$:

\begin{align*} &=  \blue{40^\circ}+\blue{60^\circ}+\blue{90^\circ}\\
&= 190^\circ\\&>\pink{180^\circ}\end{align*}

The $3$ angles sum up to a value greater than $\pink{180^\circ}$.

\paragraph{Hint 3}Given the conditions, no triangles can be drawn.

**Given these criteria is the triangle unique?**
[[? interactive-graph 1]]

\paragraph{Ans} 

\fbox{ Yes

}

 No



\paragraph{Hint 1}Let’s start by drawing a right angle which is $\blue{90^\circ}$. 

Then, let's draw the side of length $\blue4$ next to the right angle, so our base has a length of $\blue4$.

\paragraph{Hint 2}The side of length $\blue4$ is $\red{\text{not}}$ between $2$ angles $\blue{58^\circ}$ and $\blue{90^\circ}$. 

Since we drew the side of length $\blue4$ next to the right angle, the $\blue{58^\circ}$ angle must be *opposite* the side of length $\blue4$ .

\paragraph{Hint 3}We know the measure of $2$ angles and the length of $1$ side not between the angles, so we can draw only $1$ triangle.

\paragraph{Hint 4}The triangle is unique.

\paragraph{Ans} 

\fbox{ Yes

 No



\paragraph{Hint 1}Let’s start by drawing the length of $1$ side, which we know is $\blue5$.  

\paragraph{Hint 2}From the side $\blue5$, let’s draw $2$ $\blue{58^\circ}$ angles. Since we have $2$ equal angles, we have an isosceles triangle. An isosceles triangle has at least $2$ sides equal in length. 

Since we have $2$ $\blue{58^\circ}$ angles, the third angle must be $\green{64^\circ}$. The sum of $3$ angles in a triangle will always be $\pink{180^\circ}$.

\paragraph{Hint 3}We know the measure of $2$ angles and the length of the side between the angles, so we can draw only $1$ triangle.

\paragraph{Hint 4}The triangle is unique.

\paragraph{Ans} 

Yes

\fbox{ No

\paragraph{Hint 1}Let’s start by drawing. While keeping $1$ angle, we can change the side lengths to create $1$ of the other $2$ angles.

For example, while keeping a $\blue{45^\circ}$ angle, we can change the side lengths to create the $\blue{35^\circ}$ angle. The final angle will be $\blue{100^\circ}$.

\paragraph{Hint 2}We know the measure of $3$ angles but not the length of any side. We can draw many triangles of the same shape but different sizes.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A triangle is a plane figure with $3$ straight sides and $3$ angles. Can we satisfy the definition given the conditions? Let's try to draw a triangle given the conditions.

\paragraph{Hint 2}In general, the longest side of a triangle must be shorter than the sum of the two other sides. Because $\blue{1}+\blue{2} =\blue{3}$, the two sides $\blue{1}$ and $\blue{2}$ cannot meet to form a third angle. We cannot create $3$ angles to satisfy the definition of a triangle.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A triangle is a plane figure with $3$ straight sides and $3$ angles. The $3$ angles always add up to $\pink{180^\circ}$. Let's add together the angles $\blue{30}^\circ$,  $\blue{50}^\circ$ and $\blue{100}^\circ$:

\begin{align*} &= \blue{30^\circ}+\blue{50^\circ}+\blue{180^\circ}\\
&=\pink{180^\circ}\end{align*}

So, at least $1$ triangle exists. Let's start by drawing.

\paragraph{Hint 2}We know the measure of $3$ angles but not the length of any side. We can draw many triangles with the same shape but different sizes.

\paragraph{Hint 1}A triangle is a plane figure with $3$ straight sides and $3$ angles.
